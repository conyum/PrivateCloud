# PrivateCloud

*What is PrivateCloud?*

simple, a GUI to upload files private to a server where its encrypted and you can share the file through a hash

**how do it work?**

Easy, it works by users uploading encrypted or unencrypted files to the API where the user get a hash to share. share the hash to other users and they'll be able to download the file.

the program was intended to be a message platform where youn share a encrypted file and share your encryption-key, but it took a turn and became that AND a filesharing service
